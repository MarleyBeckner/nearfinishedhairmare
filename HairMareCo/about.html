            <h2>About The Founder</h2>
          <h4>Marley Beckner is a 15-year-old black male from Los Angeles. He is a student at North Torrance High School and a genius from The Hidden Genius Project. He loves video games, tv shows, running track, and style. Marley has been interested in creation and computer science since a young age and now he is using this interest, using it to create a business beneficial to his community. All he wants is a world where it's easy to be expressive through your hair even if you have little knowledge of it like he once was</h4>
          <h2>Why?</h2>
          <h4>Marley realized around the time that he came up with the idea of the business that his brother fully didn't understand how to take care of his hair despite him having really nice long dreads. It always bothered him that only a week after getting a retwist that his brother's hair would be messed up. It hit him that not everyone understood their hair and how to take care of it. Marley had also been asked multiple times who had done his hair because people were looking for someone to do his hair. It had also occurred to him that not everyone had much access to getting their hair done because they didn't know where to do so.  Marley wanted to do something about this so when given the opportunity to make his own business he knew that this could be very beneficial to his community </h4>
